                <p class="mb-2">ST815 is our brand new casual-dining neighbourhood restaurant offering Lunch and Dinner from Wednesday to Saturday plus Sunday Lunch. In case you were wondering, the ST815 team will be conjuring up magical new menu ideas every Monday and Tuesday to be enjoyed for the rest of the week, as well as the odd bit of R&R!</p>
                <p>ST815 is somewhere to go and meet friends for a drink and a few plates of nibbles, to meet your partner for a weekend meal of quality, somewhere to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and eat out during your trips to Oxford and somewhere for the whole family on Sundays.</p>
